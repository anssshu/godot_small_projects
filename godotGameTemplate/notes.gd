#This file is only to document the game project

#the file structure will be like this

# res-|--levels
#     |--prefabs
#     |--default_env.tres
#     |--globals.gd
#     |--icon.png

#all the levels will be written inside the levels folder
#all the game objects will be written inside the prefab folders


# each level folder will contain 1tscn file and 1 script file for that level 
# and all the objects from the prefabs will be connected in the tscn file 
# the script file will dictate the game logic of that stage 


#for creating a level the story of the game should be prepared first
#then background,hud,player all other objects and scene layout shold be created separetely as separate prefabs
#then each prefabs should be connected in the tscn file 
#finally the level script should be written and connected to the level.


#similarly multiple levels should be created and finally the game to be completed.
